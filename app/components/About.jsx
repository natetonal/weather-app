        This is a really cool weather app. This is actually my 3rd weather app now. I feel like there's a conspiracy about
        teachers forcing students into creating weather apps from OpenWeatherMap. I think I get the idea by now, but it's
        always still good to go through it again just to make sure there's nothing I've missed.
